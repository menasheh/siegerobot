SiegeRobot
================
This project ran a userbot to automate playing BastionSiege v1, a chat-based game which used to be available on Telegram via `@BastionSiegeBot <https://telegram.me/bastionsiegebot>`_. Now that BastionSiege has been replaced with a new  version, its use is purely educational.

This project was created for fun and to build a skill in asynchronous python programming.

Entry point is at `src/siege/main.py`. This has the asyncio web interface for adding new users and reporting on the health of each Siege instance. The main logic is in `BastionSiege.py`.
